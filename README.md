### How to navigate my project
Search for any kind of recipe or protein you want to start with. For example,
                        "Pizza" or "Steak‚Äù will display recipes and some detailed information about the recipes. Also,
                        You can save recipes by double clicking the name of the recipe you want to save. Then by
                        clicking, Favorite Recipes! in the navigation bar. It will display URL links to that saved
                        recipe from local storage. What to Drink tab on the navigation bar will pair wine to go with
                        whatever meal you are having. Click the search box and type in the meal you plan on having. For
                        example, "Pasta Bolognese" or "Fish" will display the right kind of wine to go with the meal you
                        enter. Also display the price of that wine.
